- name: SEAplanes
  i18n: pb
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/seaplanes.png
  desc: SEAplanes (Simulation Execution Architecture - Proto-Logical-processor
        Allocation Nodes with Extensible inline Scheduler), is a C++14
        framework for distributed simulation with real-time and constrained-
        time capabilities, based on HLA-CERTI, with Qt5 interface.

- name: RROSACE
  i18n: pb
  gh_user: hnrck
  repo: rrosace
  img:  https://github.com/hnrck/rrosace/blob/master/res/rrosace.png
  desc: RROSACE (Redundant - Research Open-Source Avionics and Control
        Engineering) is an open-source C library of simulation components for
        redundant longitudinal flight controller simulation based on ROSACE.

- name: allocation-tool
  i18n: pb
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/allocation.png
  desc: Python extensible modular cyber-physical simulation allocation
        tool.
        The front-end modules parse simulation logical architecture formalism
        file, simulation execution architecture file, load an heuristic (*-fit
        or simulated annealing for now), and generates an intermediate
        scheduling.
        The back-end modules generate configuration for industrial simulators,
        or partially generated code for SEAplanes.

  repo: pretended-blockchain
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/pretended-blockchain.png
  desc: A simple implementation of blockchain in Haskell

- name: Simple homemade IoT
  i18n:
  url:
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/iot.png
  desc: Wireless sensors network with Arduinos and Raspberry Pi, development
    of drivers in C, Ada and ARM assembly, python server with MySQL, and web
    interface for monitoring.

- name: B.A.T.M.A.N. on drone
  i18n: batman
  url:
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/batman.png
  desc: Integration of the B.A.T.M.A.N. Meshed ad hoc mobile network protocol
    on embedded Linux for drones and on-ground router for quick deployment of
    access networks.

- name: Simple File Transfert Protocol
  i18n: sftp
  url:
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/arrow.png

  i18n: pb
  gh_user: viveris
  repo: librle
  img:
  desc: Implementation of the ETSI defined standard for RLE, compatible
        with Linux (user and kernel space).
        Contributed while working at Viveris for Thal√®s Alenia Space.
        Opened and integrated to OpenSand.

- name: Contributions to INET Framework for OMNEST/OMNeT++
  i18n: pb
  gh_user: hnrck
  repo: inet
