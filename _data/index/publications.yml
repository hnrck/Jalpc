    detail: "This paper presents ongoing work on the formalism of Cyber-Physical
        Systems (CPS) simulations. These systems are distributed real-time
        systems, and their simulations might be distributed or not. In this
        paper, we propose a model to describe the modular components forming a
        simulation of a CPS. The main goal is to introduce a model of generic
        simulation distributed architecture, on which we are able to execute a
        logical architecture of simulation. This architecture of simulation
        allows the expression of structural and behavioural constraints on the
        simulation, abstracting its execution. We will propose two
        implementations of the execution architecture based on generic
        architectures of distributed simulation: The High Level Architecture
        (HLA), an IEEE standard for distributed simulation, and one of its
        open-source implementation of RunTime Infrastructure (RTI): CERTI. The
        Distributed Simulation Scheduler (DSS), an Airbus framework scheduling
        predefined models. Finally, we present the initial results obtained
        applying our formalism to the open-source case study from the ROSACE
        case study."
