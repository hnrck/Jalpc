    detail: "This paper presents ongoing work on the formalism of Cyber-Physical
      Systems (CPS) simulations. We focus on a distributed simulations
      architecture for CPS, where the running simulators exist in concurrent and
      sequential domains. This architecture of simulation allows the expression
      of structural and behavioral constraints on the simulation. We call
      scheduling of simulation the temporal organization of the simulators
      interconnection. In this paper we address the problem of the
      interconnected simulations representativity. To do so, we highlight the
      similarities and differences between task scheduling and simulation
      scheduling, and then we discuss the constraints expressible over that
      simulation scheduling. Finally, we illustrate a constraint on simulation
      scheduling with an extension of the open source case study ROSACE,
      implemented with CERTI, a compliant High-Level Architecture (HLA) RunTime
      Infrastructure (RTI). HLA is an IEEE standard for distributed simulation."

    detail: "The goal of this position paper is to contribute for the improving
      of Cyber-Physical System (CPS) simulations by introducing distribution.
      CPS use computations and communication tightly interacting with physical
      processes. So a CPS simulation needs to tackle with three kinds of
      simulations: the computational simulation, the physical simulation, and
      the communication simulation. In this paper, we will focus on the
      communication simulation, and its interaction with the two others
      simulations. We will draw a landscape of the existing concepts and
      technologies for distributing communication simulation, and then propose
      an architecture for interacting with the whole CPS simulation. We will
      apply this architecture to a simulation of a satellite constellation,
      where satellites can be simulated with different levels of precision, from
      the simple generic mathematical model to the heavy-featured CPS
      simulation."

    detail: "This paper presents ongoing work on the formalism of Cyber-Physical
      Systems (CPS) simulations. These systems are distributed real-time
      systems, and their simulations might be distributed or not. In this
      paper, we propose a model to describe the modular components forming a
      simulation of a CPS. The main goal is to introduce a model of generic
      simulation distributed architecture, on which we are able to execute a
      logical architecture of simulation. This architecture of simulation
      allows the expression of structural and behavioural constraints on the
      simulation, abstracting its execution. We will propose two
      implementations of the execution architecture based on generic
      architectures of distributed simulation: The High Level Architecture
      (HLA), an IEEE standard for distributed simulation, and one of its
      open-source implementation of RunTime Infrastructure (RTI): CERTI. The
      Distributed Simulation Scheduler (DSS), an Airbus framework scheduling
      predefined models. Finally, we present the initial results obtained
      applying our formalism to the open-source case study from the ROSACE
      case study."
